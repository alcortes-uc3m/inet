Two isolated networks, each of them with
an SCTP multihomed sender and an SCTP
multihomed receiver.

A network failure will occur at second
3, rendering the primary paths unusable.

In the upper network a vanilla SCTP is
used, it will take several seconds to
recover from the failure. The lower
network uses SCTP-AP (Active Probing,
experimental), thus detecting the path
failure earlier.
